# ✅ Codacy Setup Complete

## 🎯 Overview
Successfully configured **Codacy code coverage reporting** for the Sorriso Inteligente PWA project. The system is now fully operational and ready for continuous code quality monitoring.

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. **Jest Coverage Generation**
- **Coverage Reporters**: `text`, `lcov`, `html`, `json`
- **TypeScript Support**: Full support via `ts-jest@28.0.8`
- **Coverage Files**: Generated in `coverage/` directory
- **Test Results**: 42/44 tests passing (95.5% success rate)

### 2. **Codacy Integration**
- **API Configuration**: Environment variables properly set
- **Coverage Upload**: Automated via `bash <(curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh)`
- **Upload Status**: ✅ "Coverage data uploaded. Coverage received successfully"
- **Project Settings**: 
  - Organization: `gh/gabrimachado147`
  - Project: `sorriso-inteligente-app`

### 3. **Coverage Metrics**

  extensionsToTreatAsEsm: ['.ts', '.tsx'],
  coverageReporters: ['text', 'lcov', 'html', 'json'],
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 50,
      functions: 50,
      lines: 50,
      statements: 50,

```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **✅ COMPLETED**: Basic Codacy setup working
2. **✅ COMPLETED**: Coverage reports generated and uploaded
3. **✅ COMPLETED**: Automated scripts functional

### Future Enhancements
